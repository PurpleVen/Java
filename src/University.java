/*
5. A university has two types of students â€” graduate students and research students.
        The University maintains the record of name, age and programme of every student.
        For graduate students, additional information like percentage of marks and stream, like
        science, commerce, etc. is recorded;
        whereas for research students, additionally, specialization and years of working experience, if any, is recorded.
        Each class has a constructor. The constructor of subclasses makes a call to constructor of the superclass.
        Assume that every constructor has the same number of parameters as the
        number of instance variables.
        In addition, every subclass has a method that may update the instance variable values of that subclass.
        All the classes have a function display_student_info( ), the subclasses must override this method of the base class.
